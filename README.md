# Advanced Bayesian A/B testing Project

## Topics Covered

Here are the main topics and concepts covered in this project:

- üßÆ **Bernoulli Trials with Beta Priors and Monte Carlo Simulations**
- üìä **Beta-Binomial Model with CLT Approximations**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Experimentation Risk Analysis using Gaussian Quadratures**
- üìâ **Normal-Normal Model for Continuous Variables**
- üîç **Risk Analysis using Gaussian Quadratures (for Normal-Normal Model)**


## Project Overview

The main purpose of this project is to **compare Frequentist A/B testing approaches with Bayesian methods** and demonstrate why Bayesian methods offer superior interpretability and explainability in their results. Through this project, I aim to showcase the enhanced insights that Bayesian methods can provide in real-world scenarios, which are often complex and require nuanced decision-making.

## Case-Based Approach

This project is designed around a **case-based scenario**, where I formulated the analysis to closely resemble real-world situations that businesses and data scientists frequently encounter. By grounding the project in a realistic context, I hope to make the methodologies and results more relatable and applicable to actual challenges in the field.

## Detailed Analysis

The project is **very lengthy** and covers multiple advanced statistical and mathematical concepts in great detail. Each step, from data cleaning to risk analysis, is meticulously documented to help others understand not only the "how" but also the "why" behind each method. 

If you're looking for specific sections or details, I encourage you to use **command+F** (or the equivalent on Windows) to quickly navigate to the parts that interest you. A table of contents is provided below to facilitate this:

## Purpose and Goals

The project is aimed at providing a **detailed, step-by-step explanation** of complex mathematical methods used in Bayesian A/B testing. The goal is to help others grasp these advanced concepts, even if they are new to them, by breaking down the math and logic into understandable pieces. This project is as much about education as it is about showcasing the practical applications of these methods.
